This project hosts the website of the PharoDays conference.

The website is based on the free HTML template *Eventre By Themefisher* available at: https://github.com/themefisher/Eventre-Event-Conference-Template

We only use the one-page website defined in the `index.html` page.
From the *Eventre By Themefisher* theme, the following files have been copied to the *docs* folder:
- 404.html
- css folder
- FAQ.html
- images folder
- index.html
- js folder
- plugins folder

Docs folder is automatically published on Gitlab pages: https://pharo-project.github.io/pharodays
